# Weather Forecast Case Study
 Accurately predicting precipitation events can be very challenging, particularly in terms of duration, amount, and location of the rainfall. The further into the future one looks, the less accurate the forecasts become. This project focuses on the short- and medium-term forecasting of a heavy rainfall event in Western Germany in May 2024. For this purpose, the historical forecast data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for a period before the predicted event will be examined, as well as how these forecasts have evolved over time.

Part of the project will be the access and downloading of the forecast data, processing and visualizing these data. The following sections describe the structure of the repository and included files and needed modules, instructions how to access the data, description of the data processing part and final conclusions.
